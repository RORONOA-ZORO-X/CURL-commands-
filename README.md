For making parrot dance; type:                                                                                                                                                                                         
curl ascii.live/parrot                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Then for making Rick dance; type:                                                                                                                                                                                      
curl ascii.live/rick                                                                                                                                                                                                   
BUT, keep in mind that you can only execute one command at a time.                                                                                                                                                     
i.e. if you type parrot command then you should restart CMD tereminal to excute another curl command.///
